# PREDICT WITH SAM 
## A machine learning disease-predictor model

*A machine learning disease prediction model integrated with a health chatbot serves as an innovative tool for proactive healthcare management. Leveraging sophisticated algorithms, this model analyzes patient data to predict the likelihood of various diseases with high accuracy. Simultaneously, the chatbot component offers a platform for users to freely discuss health-related concerns, symptoms, and queries. By combining predictive analytics with conversational interfaces, the system empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and seek timely medical assistance. Furthermore, the chatbot's accessibility fosters a supportive environment for users to engage in open dialogue, promoting proactive health monitoring and preventive care.*
